### What I've learned
In this class I have learned the use of `ssh` and `scp` for connecting remotely to a server.  
I also learned how to do things on the command line with these commands:
> ``` 
> ls
> cd
> cat
> touch
> mkdir
> ```  
We also setup an ssh keygen to get to the server without having to input out password.
