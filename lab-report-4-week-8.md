## Questions
1. ### *Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.*  
> I think there could be a small code change by checking the back ticks to resolve the code so it can work for snippet1  


2. ### *Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.*  
> I think there could be a small code change by checking how many open and close parentheses are there and identifying which one will contain the actual link.

3. ### *Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.*  
> I think there needs to be a more involved change for this one because it has to check if the parentheses is closed or not.
